                                My name is Ala Eddine Boudjatit. I was born on the 22nd of April, 2004 in Algeria. When I was only 3 years old my parents migrated to the Middle East in hopes to obtain and provide a better life
                                for my siblings and I. I have 2 brothers, one was born on 2006 and the other in 2003, so I am a middle child. Growing up, I studied in international schools attempting to master
                                my fluency of english to be able to communicate with those around me. Soon enough though, I found myself comfortable in a place that I could call home. As time passed, 15 years in such a place
                                felt like only 2 and I soon found myself graduating and heading to Aberdeen to study Computer science.

                                I like to consider myself as a man of many hobbies. To start, I enjoy teaching myself new things, wether it be learning new code or opening an online business. On ocassion,
                                I like to read self-improvement books and articles, I find these very motivating and eye-opening. In my free time I usually participate in some casual gaming or play casual football with friends.
                                Currently, I play for the Aberdeen University Football Club and it has been a very enjoyable experience so far. Last but not least, I am really enthusiastic 
                                about everthing to do with computers, I enjoy building them, reading about them, and now I am learning how to make them do exactly what I want.

                                As I mentioned before, from a young age I have had a strong love with computer systems. I came across codeacademy when I was about 12 years old and began to do some practice
                                for fun as I found it very interesting. Over time I began to gain more and more interest in learning new languages and impleneting them into projects. I also began taking
                                computing courses at my school, and I found myself quite good at them. When the time came to make a decision, there was never any doubt in my choice. I chose computing science
                                as my first choice for every application, and here I am now.
